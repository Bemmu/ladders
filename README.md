All I know is that it has physics and is somehow about little stick men that climb ladders. Just prototyping this for fun to learn Haxe and Box2D. I don't have a grand plan. Makes it more interesting to work on it as I don't know where it's going.

The graphics are placeholders ripped from Lode Runner that I'll replace at some point.
